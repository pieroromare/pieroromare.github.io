<h4>Big Tech Fines 2023</h4>
<h7>Do the big tech provide a service or a product that is free? No, they don't. They are selling our data and it might be okay for some people, but as every market, they should follow the law. The European Union has been one of the first to take action, but the fines are not enough. Just take a look on this <a href="https://proton.me/blog/big-tech-2023-fines-vs-revenue">Proton post</a> for futher information and on how they did the calculations. The table is reported below and can be also double verified, at least for what concern the European fines, by looking at <a href="https://www.enforcementtracker.com/">GDPR Enforcement Tracker</a>.
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Fines in $ in 2023</th>
    <th>Time to pay them off</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Alphabet</td>
   <td>941 million</td>
   <td>1 day, 3 hours, 55 minutes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Amazon</td>
    <td>111.7 million</td>
    <td>1 hour, 50 minutes</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
   <td>Apple</td>
   <td>186.4 million</td>
   <td>4 hours, 15 minutes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Meta</td>
    <td>1720 million</td>
    <td>5 days, 13 hours, 25 minutes</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
   <td>Microsoft</td>
   <td>84 million</td>
   <td>3 hours, 30 minutes</td>
  </tr>
</table>
P.S. companies somehow refuse to pay the fines.

<p id="interdisciplinarity"></p>
<h4>Interdisciplinarity</h4>
<h7>An interdisciplinary study means integrating the contributions from different disciplines. It involves getting familiar with, adherence to, and selecting what approaches from various fields would best produce the desired outcome. A publication could lead the development of novel solutions to complex research questions, reach a larger audience and have a great impact on society <a href="https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-019-0352-4">[1]</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010006">[2]</a>.
<br><br>
Some definitions from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17330451/">[3]</a>:
<li>Disciplinarity: the study of a specific subject or field, focusing on its own rules, methods, and principles.</li>
<li>Multidisciplinarity: the study of a subject from multiple different disciplines simultaneously, but the disciplines remain separate from each other.</li>
<li>Interdisciplinarity: the study of approaches from different disciplines into a new and coherent whole.</li>
<li>Transdisciplinarity: the study that integrates and transcends disciplinary boundaries, bridging humanities and sciences.</li>
<br>
Quickly in practice, writing an interdisciplinary research paper requires explaining why focusing on just one topic is insufficient, as well as outlining the disciplines that should be included, their motivations, and their points of view <a href="https://www.southwestern.edu/live/files/3946-interdisciplinary">[4]</a>. So far so good, but how is it possible to submit the paper then? It is challenging finding suitable outlets for publication (and reviewers), as well as in meeting the standards and demonstrate the impact across different disciplines. The communication to specialized researcher in a single topic may have their own clique and may not want to include different perspectives, but a few sensational and complex terms might be added to get their attention. When a talk is given, there should be less use of acronyms and technical vocabulary since it's not good to focus just on a single or a small group of specialized people, the audience is various and might be also outside the room. To encourage the development of a cohesive research team of researchers from several fields, more effort is required <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267234">[5]</a> <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/imposter-syndrome-diversity-underrepresented-employees-inclusion">underrepresented background</a>.
<br><br>
I had the opportunity to chat with seniors about this topic, and I have collected some of their thoughts. I didn't ask for their permission to share their names, so I will keep them anonymous. From a professor at CMU: <em>"you need to find the magic words to interact with specialized people"</em>. From a former professor at MIT, now in the industry: <em>"with literature classes and washing machine classes, you can build great eyes and great hands, because youâ€™ll be able to learn from one subject and apply it to another"</em>. 
<br><br>
Interdisciplinarity has a comorbidity with the <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/types-of-imposter-syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. But being stupid is not so bad <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.033340">[6]</a>. An italian economics, Piero Formica, gave a insightful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxj8o7m0a8s">TED Talk</a> in italian, but caption are available. He reports in particular the story about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison">John Harriston</a> and mentions about <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3020/3020-h/3020-h.htm#link2H_4_0008">William Hazlitt</a>, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20013918">Socrates</a>, and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/cusanus/">Nicolas of Cusa</a>.

<p id="cognitive-bias"></p>
<h4>Cognitive Bias</h4>
<h7>Cognitive biases and heuristics serve as mental shortcuts that enable individuals to simplify the complexity of tasks when making judgments and choices. Biases, in turn, arise as the disparities between expected or ideal behavior.</h7>
<p> I like this representation arranged and designed by John Manoogian III (jm3). Categories and descriptions originally by Buster Benson.</p>

<h4>Working Hours Tracker</h4>
<h7>This AppleScript is designed exclusively for MacBooks and is not compatible with iPhones. It leverages iOS Shortcuts to streamline time tracking effortlessly.</h7><br>
<em>Start Time: Click the shortcut once, and it will automatically update your "Working Time" note with the current start time. This marks the beginning of your work session.<br>
Finish Time: When your work session is complete, click the shortcut again. This action will generate the finish time, indicating the end of your work session.</em><br><br>
<h5>Tracker with iOS Notes</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Notes app on your iOS device.</li>
        <li>Create a new note and give it the title "Working time." You can do this by tapping the "+" button to create a new note and then giving it a title.</li>
        <li>Open the Shortcuts app on your iOS device.</li>
        <li>Tap the "+" button to create a new shortcut.</li>
        <li>In the Shortcuts app, on the right-hand side, you'll see a search bar.</li>
        <li>Type "Execute with AppleScript" in the search bar to find the corresponding action.</li>
        <li>Once you find the "Execute with AppleScript" action, tap on it to add it to your shortcut.</li>
        <li>After adding the action, you can tap on it to configure it.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste the AppleScript code that follows. This code should perform the specific task you want to automate.</li>
        <li>After adding the AppleScript code, you can tap the play button (usually a triangle or "Run" button) at the top right of the Shortcuts app to simulate or test your shortcut.</li>
        <li>Once you've tested your shortcut and it works as expected, you can close it by tapping the "Done" button in the top right corner.</li>
        <li>Your shortcut should now appear in the list of available shortcuts in the Shortcuts app.</li>
        <li>To add the shortcut to your Dock for easy access, you can long-press (or right-click, depending on your device) on the shortcut's icon in the Shortcuts app.</li>
        <li>From the context menu that appears, select the option to "Add to the Dock." This will place the shortcut on your device's Dock for quick access.</li>
    </ol>

<pre style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
on run {input, parameters}
    tell application "Notes"
        set currentDate to current date
        set currentTime to time string of currentDate
        set currentDateTime to date string of currentDate & " " & currentTime
        
        set workingTimeNote to note "Working time"
        set noteContent to body of workingTimeNote
        
        if noteContent does not contain "start " & (date string of currentDate) then
            set newContent to noteContent & return & "start " & currentDateTime
        else
            set newContent to noteContent & return & "finish " & currentDateTime
        end if
        
        set body of workingTimeNote to newContent
        quit
    end tell
</pre>
<br><br>
<h5>Tracker with a txt file</h5>
<h7>Another version is using the AppleScript + a Python script.</h7>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the terminal and type the following command: pip install datetime</li>
        <li>Create in a folder (that we call yourpath) a Python script that we call (yourpythonscript.py) and copy and paste the following</li>
<pre style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
import os
import datetime

current_date = datetime.datetime.now()
current_date_string = current_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y %H:%M:%S')

desktop_path = os.path.expanduser("yourpath")
text_file_name = "working_hours.txt"
file_path = os.path.join(desktop_path, text_file_name)
if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
    open(file_path, 'w').close()

with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    file_content = file.read()

if "start" not in file_content.split('\n')[-1]:
    new_content = file_content + f"\nstart {current_date_string}"
else:
    new_content = file_content + f"\nfinish {current_date_string}"

with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
    file.write(new_content)
</pre>
        <li>Now start from the point 3 of the previous version Track with Notes</li>
        <li>In this version, the only difference is that in the AppleScript code in your shortcut add just the following</li>
<pre style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
do shell script "python3 yourpath/yourpythonscript.py"
</pre>
