<h4>Peter Hall Tv</h4>
<h7>
More than 10 years ago, with my friends Filippo, Federico and Andrea, we created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@peterhalltv">YouTube channel</a> called Peter Hall Tv. <br>
During that time, we streamed online techno music. We were one of the first to do it in Italy thanks also to Youtube which at that time did not ask for a certain amount of subscribers to allow the streaming. We streamed every two weeks, on Sunday evenings, by hosting several DJs from our city.<br>

<br>
"PETER HALL is a project born out of a passion for underground music, we decided to give space to young artists in the area who want to share their sound online and live, thus allowing other music and dancefloor enthusiasts to confront each other and have fun discovering new sounds and trends, passion is fundamental in Peter Hall TV, living music to the fullest seeks".

<h4>Proiem</h4>
<h7>
During the years of high school I started a online shop. I was a reseller of streetwear brands including <a href="https://eu.supreme.com">Supreme</a>, <a href="https://www.palaceskateboards.com">Palace</a>, <a href="https://eu.stussy.com">Stussy</a>, <a href="https://hufworldwide.eu">Huf</a>, <a href="https://obeyclothing.eu">Obey</a>. This helped me a lot to understand the world of e-commerce and the world of streetwear. I experimented coding as a self-teacher to build the website and the recommendation system. 
I closed it after 2 years because I had to focus on my studies at the university.
My friend Filippo helped me with the logo. <br>

<h4>Single Speed Bike</h4>
<h7>
I have always been passionate about cycling. I have been riding a bike since I was a child. I have always been fascinated by the world of fixed gear bikes. I bought my first fixed gear bike in 2012. I built it with my father. I bought the frame and the components separately and I assembled them. I have been riding it for many years and many accidents happended, but I didn't like the breaks.

<h4>Music</h4>
<h7>
I have always been passionate about music. I started around the end of the middle school and I ran alone a techno project under the name of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/peter-niemi">Peter Niemi</a>, a few embarassing songs should be still also on Spotify. 
<br>

<br>
With my friend Stefan, we started a duo of electronic music called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thelements">ThElements</a>. We had a lot of fun. 
<br>
