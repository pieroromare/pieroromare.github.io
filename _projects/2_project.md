title: Law and Order - a Search Engine for Italian Law
description: Law and Order is a tool in which to retrieve jurisprudence cases. We implement the state-of-art of Natural Language Processing to the legal domain. We apply computational models to legal reasoning and behaviour, to extract legal knowledge, infer relationships, and encourage data-driven insights. We build a working prototype of a search engine for a web application.

Digital transformation is a technology-induced change on many levels in the organization that includes both the exploitation of digital technologies to improve existing processes and the exploration of digital innovation, which can potentially transform the business model. Tech- nology innovation has shared knowledge and, by involving different resources, has permitted, in general, time-saving, data-driven insights, and predictions. When is it known a behaviour, many processes can be modelled and perform in a better way.
Texts are one kind of data produced on a large scale every day and different methodologies have been proposed to automatically extract information from texts and provide a structured organisation of extracted knowledge in diverse domains as bioinformatics, healthcare, company document bases (i.e., finance), and misinformation are some examples.
The legal field is in line with the start of this general trend, but with some shortcomings. This is due to the difference in legislation in the countries. In fact, in other countries, there are many online legal services to improve law firms and practices both in terms of efficiency and speed. In our country, jurisprudence still has its fixed models and regulations. Despite this, there has been progressing, think of the digital signature, certified e-mail, applications that have stimulated a different work setting, relationships between firms, lawyers and magistrates. Closely linked to legal decisions, online courts and smart working are two implications that have emerged. During the last years the merging between the use of data and law grows, from the automated legal reasoning and argumentation, semantic legal information retrieval, document classification, legal knowledge discovery and extraction to the construction of legal ontology.
With these premises, our work focus on text analytic discovery of word-related information.
in large legal corpora. Our aim is to build a search engine web application starting from collect- ing semi-structured legal texts. By taking into account the Italian law practice, we apply the Nat- ural Language Processing (NLP) to judgements and ordinances of Corte Costituzionale. By processing text data using NLP approaches we explore and implement different search-engines. Search engines are methods that aim is to find from a collection of documents who are good matches to user queries. The Inverted Index is one of the first techniques found. We test in other versions of search-engine some keyword extraction techniques to assign weights to the words. These allow us to provide a ranking of documents. Lastly, we investigate the state-of-art of NLP by using Word Embedding, in particular Word2Vec, and Document Embedding, in particular Doc2Vec. Both consist in representing words to a space of features vectors, respectively words and documents. Thanks to these techniques, we are able to amplify the user query, rank documents and find similarities between them. Then, we build a prototype of a web application of these search engines using Flask.
